## Problem 1

a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution a logical
vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 a
character vector of length 10 a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

``` r
set.seed(123)
la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE,FALSE),
  vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("abc","abc","abc","abc","hij","hij","hij","efg","efg","efg"))
)

samp1 = pull(la_df, norm_samp)
samp2 = pull(la_df, vec_logical)
samp3 = pull(la_df, vec_char)
samp4 = pull(la_df, vec_factor)

as.numeric(samp1)
```

    ##  [1] -0.56047565 -0.23017749  1.55870831  0.07050839  0.12928774  1.71506499
    ##  [7]  0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197

``` r
as.numeric(samp2)
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0

``` r
as.numeric(samp3)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(samp4)

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe

The mean of the variable norm\_samp is 0.0746256. The mean of the
variable vec\_logical is 0.5. The mean of the variable vec\_char is NA.
The mean of the variable vec\_factor is NA.

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and
what doesn’t? The mean of variable vec\_char doesn’t work. The mean of
the variable vec\_factor doesn’t work.

Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical,
character, and factor variables. By using the as.numeric function, only
the the vector character doesn’t work. Although, when taking the mean of
each variable, both the vector character and the vector factor can not
get the mean.

## Problem 2

download the a package containing the penguins dataset and to load the
penguins dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

description of the penguins dataset the data in this dataset, including
names/values of important variables.

The name of the penguins dataset are species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The size
of the dataset is 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is
200.9152047.

Make a scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
